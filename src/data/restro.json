Ordered lunch for a group of 15 last week and it was a great experience. Called in the order the day before, and they called me about an hour before pickup to confirm the order and give me the chance to make last minute changes. Food was ready on time, and they even helped me carry it out to my car.",

I would rate the taste 9.5/10 with 10/10 in pricing. As of today I loved chicken65 biryani and chicken starters that I tried.",

I ordered Chicken Biryani and my first impression was 'Man this seems to be a big portion'. Opened up the container and the aromatic basmati rice with an abundance of chicken and the first bite gave me that Wowww. So flavorful and perfect balance of spices meat and rice with yogurt raita. I would definitely go again and try other dishes that they offer. Highly recommended 👏👏",
